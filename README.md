Welcome to the Recursion Mastery project! This repository showcases my journey in conquering recursion. As someone who initially found recursion challenging, I was determined to improve my skills. Through perseverance and dedication, I tackled various recursion problems, honing my understanding and problem-solving capabilities.

## Introduction

Recursion is a powerful and elegant technique used in computer science and programming. However, it can be quite tricky to grasp initially. This project documents my efforts to master recursion by systematically solving a wide range of recursion problems. Each solution reflects my understanding of recursion principles, design patterns, and algorithms.

## Challenges

The challenges I tackled covered various aspects of recursion, including:

- **Basic Recursion**: Implementing simple recursive functions to understand the fundamental concepts.
- **Recursion with Lists**: Solving problems involving recursive manipulation of lists and arrays.
- **Recursion with Trees**: Navigating and manipulating tree-like data structures using recursion.

- **Divide and Conquer**: Employing recursive divide and conquer strategies for efficient problem-solving.

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ basic_recursion/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem1_solution.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem2_solution.py

â”œâ”€â”€ recursion_with_lists/

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem2_solution.py

â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Each category of recursion problems has its own folder containing multiple solutions to different problems.

## How to Use

To explore my solutions to the recursion challenges, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dappa88/recursion-mastery.git
```

2. Navigate to the folder of the specific category or problem you want to explore.

3. Open the `solution.py` file to review the code and understand the recursive implementation.

4. Execute the Python script to run the solution or test it with custom inputs if applicable.

```bash
python solution.py
```

5. Feel free to experiment with the provided code and observe the recursive behavior.
